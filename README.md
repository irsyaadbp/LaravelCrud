## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.

Or you can use this way

Change name ***server.php*** to ***index.php***

Then you can open it, just open the directory to your browser
If css doesn't load, please add ***public*** to the path css

#### Example
First css path is :
```
{{ asset('/css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css') }}
```
Replace to :
```
{{ asset('public/css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css') }}
```

is not only for css, this way work to any your asset
